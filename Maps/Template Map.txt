The first number is the size of the grid, and all following information is with players, obstacles, or enemies

Player information is as follows:
    a character to identify the type of actor (p for players, e for enemies)
    one number for the index number of that type in its designated array
    one number for the x position
    one number for the y position

All other characters are irrelevant and exist for purely organizational purposes. A sample might look like this:

 -------------- START SAMPLE
Size: 12

p0 , (0 , 0) 
e10, (1 , 0)
o0 , (1 ,10)
e9 , (10, 4)
p30, (10, 5)
e2 , (11, 6)
 -------------- END SAMPLE

Important parts:

p0 , (1 , 2)        p0 , (1 , 2)        p0 , (1 , 2)        p0 , (1 , 2)
^                    ^                        ^                       ^
p is the type.       0 is the index           1 is the x              2 is the y
p codes for player.  number of the            coordinate.             coordinate.
The file reader      enemy.
checks the start of
each line for an
identifier like
this.

Important Notes:

    The code treats consecutive numeric characters (i.e. 123) as the number one-hundred and twenty-three. However, if
those numbers are seperated by a space or another character, (i.e. 1 2 3 or 1,2,3 or 1a2a3a) they would be treated
as seperate numbers.

    It is good practice to organize elements by position to avoid conflicts.
Any elements with coordinates outside of the grid (>= size) will be deleted.
