All blurbs follow a format of 16 columns by 6 rows. The scanner reads the first 16 eligibile
characters in each of the first 6 rows. Spaces are indicated by (_) underscores.

A blurb might look like this:

 -------------- START SAMPLE
A_CAT_IN_THE_HAT
WAS_A_MOVIE_THAT
TAUGHT_ME_THAT
CATS_ARE_EVIL
WITCHES_WHO_EAT
CHILDREN
123456789abcdefg
 -------------- END SAMPLE

The letters and numbers serve as character markers, so that the sample does not exeed the max length.
Only capital letters and underscores are valid characters. All others are ignored.
Empty lines are counted. Lines with only invalid characters are counted as empty lines.
